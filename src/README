Basic Education Enrollment System

I built this to learn more about OOP and to advance my skills so one day I will be a junior dev.
It is not complete, but for one of my first bigger projects it will do for now :).

What I implemented and learnt
- User interface where students choose one of four subjects with basic details
- Working with superclasses and learning more about inheritance
- Adding objects to a list
- I had issues with Grades class and Students as they both contain getters and setters for grades
- Also I had the UI broken up better but now the enrollment process is in one big chunk
- Learnt about using Github too as this was written on two different machines so I am getting used to source control

Functionality that could be added
- An algorithm which calculates the best Maths grades and puts them in top set
- Level selector based off grades
- Staff intranet with a database for username and password.
- Admin side of the program so you can see who is enrolled
- When the date gets to September 1st a timetable is sent to the students email
- Pay system for teachers
- Attendance etc
- Alot of error handling would improve the program too
